## Scrum Master Role
1. Schedule and facilitate Scrum Process meetings "ceremonies":
	1. Sprint Planning (<30 mins)
		a. When: before a sprint begins
		b. Who: scrum master, DEV lead, product owner, optional or as needed DEV/UI/QA - closed meeting
		c. Purpose: what should be in the next sprint
	1. Backlog Refinement Grooming (varies)
		a. When: as needed to maintain pointed tasks to maintain the process--don't want to get to far ahead because of short memories, always want enough for pulling into sprints AND to fill the next sprint
		b. Who: scrum master, product owner, DEV/UI/QA
		c. Purpose: Defining Tasks: what needs to be done, what is the definition of done. Questions of how just increase the points-as part of the difficulty of the task.
	1. Stand Up (~10mins)
		a. When: daily
		b. Who: scrum master, DEV/UI/QA - open to anyone in the company
		c. Purpose: view progress, identify blockers
	1. Sprint Demos (varies)
		a. When: last day of sprint or just after close of sprint
		b. Who: scrum master, demonstrators - open invite to company and stakeholders
		c. Purpose: show what was accomplished during the sprint, and reporting of story points and velocity
	1. Sprint Retrospective (30-60 mins)
		a. When: within a few days of completing a sprint.
		b. Who: scrum master, DEV lead, DEV/UI/QA - Closed meeting with anonymous results/reporting
		c. Purpose: identify what to focus on changing and what to keep the same
1. Help with pre-grooming the back log with product owner and dev lead
1. Help clear blockers for the team
1. Track sprint progress as a point person for the external stakeholders
1. Help the team make progress 
1. Invite feedback prior to Retrospective from the team and gather the information

## DEV Stand Up Format
This is a very short meeting with the entire DEV Team DEV/QA/DEV Lead and scrum master, other stakeholders are welcome and encouraged to keep their contributions concise similar to the team members check ins.

1. Each DEV/QA Team member checks in with:
   1. What did you do since the last stand up?
   1. What is blocking you or slowing you down?
   1. What are you working on next?
   1. Pick the next person?
1. Scrum Master 
   1. invites stake holders: POs, PMs, Company Leadership get a moment to add a comment
   1. Check Bug List and Triage
   1. Comments: pushing flow for the team, facilitating “offline” meetings, checking sprint progress, checking bugs being triaged and added to sprint or backlog, team decisions to add stories to a sprint in progress.
1. Meeting closes

Often right after a meeting is a great time for a short one on one or small meeting to work on blockers, gaining clarity, etc.
This is found in the CustomerVehicleManagement.Api project as entity framework migrations
